  just: The 'Paint' application is visible in the Quick Apps section of the Start menu. Clicking it will launch Microsoft Paint to begin drawing.
Step 004: click OK sig=click:500:300:
  just: The command prompt is currently active and awaiting input. Pressing Enter will execute any previously typed command, but since no specific command has been entered yet, pressing Enter here would not achieve the goal of opening Microsoft Paint.
Step 005: DONE
The task is to draw a cat face in Microsoft Paint, but the current screen shows that we are still in the Command Prompt. The previous actions indicate an attempt to launch Paint via Quick Apps or search bar; however, it appears there was confusion with entering commands incorrectly into the command prompt instead of launching Paint directly from its visible icon on Start menu.
